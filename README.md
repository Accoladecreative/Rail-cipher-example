Rail Cipher Encryption and Decryption

This repository contains a simple implementation of the Rail Cipher algorithm in JavaScript. Rail Cipher, also known as the Zigzag Cipher, is a transposition cipher that rearranges characters in a zigzag pattern to encrypt and decrypt messages. This implementation provides functions for both encrypting and decrypting text using the Rail Cipher algorithm.

Features:
- Easy-to-use JavaScript functions for encrypting and decrypting messages with the Rail Cipher algorithm.
- Supports customizable number of rails for encryption and decryption.
- Provides sample input fields and user interface to interact with the Rail Cipher functionality.

Usage:
1. Enter the plaintext message and specify the number of rails.
2. Click the "Encrypt" button to encrypt the message using the Rail Cipher algorithm.
3. The ciphertext will be displayed in the output field.
4. To decrypt the ciphertext, enter it in the plaintext field and specify the same number of rails used for encryption.
5. Click the "Decrypt" button to decrypt the ciphertext and recover the original message.

This repository serves as a learning resource and reference implementation of the Rail Cipher algorithm. Feel free to explore the code, contribute improvements, or integrate it into your own projects.
